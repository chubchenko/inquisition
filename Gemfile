gemspec

# Declare any dependencies that are still in development here instead of in
# your gemspec. These might include edge Rails or gems from your path or
# Git. Remember to move these dependencies to your gemspec before releasing
# your gem to rubygems.org.

# Your gem is dependent on dev or edge Rails. Once you can lock this
# dependency down to a specific version, move it to your gemspec.
